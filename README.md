## Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900): Foundational Cloud Concepts
- By Matthew Ulasien

- INTRODUCTION:
  - This is a specially crafted course to equip IT professionals and emerging Azure specialists with the fundamental principles of cloud computing.
  - "Start here."

- DESCRIBING CLOUD COMPUTING:
  - What is cloud computing: 
    - The delivery of computing services, servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet in order to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economics of scale. - You typically pay for services that you use, assisting in lower operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
  - Breaking it down:
    - Delivery of computing services.
    - Over the Internet.
    - On demand.
    - Key advantages:
      - Better and faster than ever before. e.g.: Server in an instant.
      - Scale up and down.
      - Greater flexibility.
      - Pay for only what you need. Lower operating costs.
      - Greater efficiency.
      - Scale as business needs change.
      - The "cloud" is:
        - Multiple vendors running multiple networked resources.
          - On-demand delivery of compute services over the Internet.
          - Perform better and faster with greater flexibility.
          - Pay only for what you need.
  - Shared responsibility model:
    - Why shared responsibility matters:
      - Clarification of roles and responsibility.
        - Efficiency and convenience.
        - Data privacy.
        - Flexibility.
        - Defined roles. (What vendor and customer are responsible for.)
      - Division of responsibility.
        - Cloud: Physical hosts, network, and datacenter.
        - Customer: Information and data. Devices. Accounts and identities.
        - Varies: Application. Network controls. O/S maintenance.
      - SAAS offloads the most responsibilities, for example.
  - Understanding cloud models:
    - Private cloud:
      - A cloud for one. Privately hosted for a single customer.
      - Completely private. No outside access. Better security and privacy.
        - Your own hardware. High upfront cost.
        - More responsibility. In charge of hardware.
        - Less flexible compared to public cloud.
        - Similiar to a tradition on-premises setup.
    - Public cloud:
      - A cloud for everyone. No unfront investment. Hosted by third-party.
        - Much more flexibility. Vendor is responsible for hardware.
        - Shared tenancy wiht other users. (With exceptions.)
    - Hybrid cloud:
      - The best of both worlds. Private connectivity. (VPN. ExpressRoute.)
      - Run workloads in the most appropriate location.
      - Skills needed to maintain both.
      - Also, multi-cloud. Workloads in Azure & AWS.
      - Azure Arc. Extend Azure management to non-Azure resources.
