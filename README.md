- By Matthew Ulasien

- INTRODUCTION:
  - This is a specially crafted course to equip IT professionals and emerging Azure specialists with the fundamental principles of cloud computing.
  - "Start here."

- DESCRIBING CLOUD COMPUTING:
  - What is cloud computing: 
    - The delivery of computing services, servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet in order to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economics of scale. - You typically pay for services that you use, assisting in lower operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
  - Breaking it down:
    - Delivery of computing services.
    - Over the Internet.
    - On demand.
    - Key advantages:
      - Better and faster than ever before. e.g.: Server in an instant.
      - Scale up and down.
      - Greater flexibility.
      - Pay for only what you need. Lower operating costs.
      - Greater efficiency.
      - Scale as business needs change.
      - The "cloud" is:
        - Multiple vendors running multiple networked resources.
          - On-demand delivery of compute services over the Internet.
          - Perform better and faster with greater flexibility.
          - Pay only for what you need.
  - Shared responsibility model:
    - Why shared responsibility matters:
      - Clarification of roles and responsibility.
        - Efficiency and convenience.
        - Data privacy.
        - Flexibility.
        - Defined roles. (What vendor and customer are responsible for.)
      - Division of responsibility.
        - Cloud: Physical hosts, network, and datacenter.
        - Customer: Information and data. Devices. Accounts and identities.
        - Varies: Application. Network controls. O/S maintenance.
      - SAAS offloads the most responsibilities, for example.
  - Understanding cloud models:
    - Private cloud:
      - A cloud for one. Privately hosted for a single customer.
      - Completely private. No outside access. Better security and privacy.
        - Your own hardware. High upfront cost.
        - More responsibility. In charge of hardware.
        - Less flexible compared to public cloud.
        - Similar to a tradition on-premises setup.
    - Public cloud:
      - A cloud for everyone. No upfront investment. Hosted by third-party.
        - Much more flexibility. Vendor is responsible for hardware.
        - Shared tenancy with other users. (With exceptions.)
    - Hybrid cloud:
      - The best of both worlds. Private connectivity. (VPN. ExpressRoute.)
      - Run workloads in the most appropriate location.
      - Skills needed to maintain both.
      - Also, multi-cloud. Workloads in Azure & AWS.
      - Azure Arc. Extend Azure management to non-Azure resources.
    - Economy of cloud computing:
      - Capital expenditures: 
        - Investments in long-term assets. Fixed assets. Land. Buildings.
        - Large, up-front investments. Physical infrastructure. Servers. Datacenters.
        - Forecast long-term needs. Large tax deduction.
      - Operational Expenditures: Ongoing expenses for business operations.
        - Little or no up-front. Cloud model. Ongoing costs. No upfront investments.
        - No need to forecast long-term needs and value.
      - Cloud model = consumption-based. Pay based upon immediate usage.
        - low usage = low costs. Can increase resources if needed.
  - Exam Tips: Describing cloud computing:
    - The cloud is: 
      - On-demand delivery of compute services over the Internet.
      - Compute, networking, storage, databases, and software.
      - Flexibility is a key advantage.
    - Shared responsibility model:
      - Ongoing, foundational topic.
      - Separation of responsibility between cloud vendor and customer.
      - Different cloud service models have different breakdowns of responsibilities.
        - Divisions of responsibility.
    - Cloud models:
      - Private cloud: Single customer. Similar to a datacenter. Not available to the public.
        - Maintenance and up-front cost.
      - Public cloud: Available to anyone. Azure, AWS, etc. Greater flexibility.
      - Hybrid cloud: Most flexibility. Connect public cloud with private workloads.
        - More complexity.
    - Expense models:
      - Capital Expenditures (CapEx): Purchase servers upfront. Forecast long-term needs/value.
        - Large up-front investments.
      - Operational Expenditures (OpEx): Cloud model. Consumption-based. Pay for only what you need right now.
        - Pay as you go.

- CLOUD SERVICE TYPES:
  - "As a service" branding:
    - IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service.
      - Cloud vendor is responsible for physical management of all the hardware.
      - Greater customization and control. Pay for what you allocate. More management overhead.
    - PaaS: Platform as a Service.
      - Cloud vendor is responsible for physical hardware and its software.
      - Development tools, database management.
      - Prepackaged cloud services. Emphasis on application development.
      - Pay for what you use. Less management overhead.
    - SaaS: Software as a Service.
      - Cloud vendor is responsible for physical hardware and its software.
      - Development tools, database management. And hosted applications.
      - Ready-to-use applications. Focus on end-user experience.
      - Minimal management overhead.
    - Varying levels of flexibility and responsibility.
  - Core cloud service types:
    1. IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service.
      - Most fundamental and base. Building block? VMs.
      - Cloud vendor is responsible for physical aspects.
      - "Pay-as-you-go managed IT infrastructure."
        - Provisioned and managed over the Internet.
        - Fundamental building block of all other cloud services.
        - VMs. Networking. O/S.
          - VM: A virtual version of a physical computer. (Infrastructure.)
            - CPU/Memory. Disk. Networking. O/S. Network controls (Firewall.)
            - Physical server. Hypervisor. Vendor managed. Hyper-V. VMware.
            - You do not interact with the physical server. You manage a single VM.
            - Run any computer software. Maximum control and flexibility. Provision instantly.
            - More control. More responsibility. 
              - Software/OS updates. User management. Network access.
    2. PaaS: Platform as a Service.
      - Vast majority. 
      - Cloud vendor manage the underlying O/S and a variety of DEV tools, dB, and business analytics.
      - "Managed development/deployment (and prepackaged) services."
      - Develop applications/solutions without managing infrastructure.
      - Cloud vendor focuses on infrastructure. You focus on developing solutions.
      - Terminology: "Fully managed." Less management overhead. Including licensing.
        - Software development. Web App deployment. Storage services. Business Analytics.
      - Serverless: Extreme PaaS! All resource management is taken away from the customer.
        - Just run code. From a pricing model you are not being changed for idle resources.
        - Azure functions = serverless.
      - Trade-offs:
        - Less control over the infrastructure.
        - Cannot make all of the decisions at the infrastructure level.
        - Prepackaged configurations. Limited choice of tools.
        - Application compatibility.
    3. SaaS: Software as a Service.
      - Most are familiar with.
      - Vendor responsibilities. And hosts the applications for the end user.
      - "A cloud-based application." Applications hosted/accessed over the Internet.
      - e.g.: Email. CRMs. Zoom. Salesforce. Slack.
      - Customer responsible for: 
        - Accounts and identities. Device management. Information and data. (Access control.)
      - SaaS applications are powered by IaaS/PaaS services.
      - Complete software solution: Ready-to-go software. Easy scaling. Pre-configured.
        - Accessed over Internet. Subscription model.
      - "Cloud-based software accessed over the Internet."
  - Defense in Depth:
    - Seven layers. Objective: Slow or stop unauthorized data access with layered defense.

      2. Identity and access: Securing identities. Access to what is needed.
      3. Perimeter: Protect network-based attacks. DDoS. Firewall.
      4. Network: Secure connectivity between resources. Deny traffic by default.
      5. Compute: Secure VM. Endpoint protection. O/S? patching.
      6. Application. Resolve vulnerabilities. Secure secrets. Design for security.
      7. Data. Primary target. Databases. Disks. SaaS applications. Control access.
  - Exam tips:
    - IaaS: Managed infrastructure/VMs. CPU/RAM/OS/networking.
      - Full control: O/S management. User access.
    - PaaS: Fully managed cloud solutions.
      - Vendor handles infrastructure. You focus on developing solutions.
      - Serverless = zero resource management.
    - SaaS: Ready-to-go, cloud-based software. Accessed over the Internet.
      - Hosting. Scaling. Subscription model.
    - Defend your data with layers of defense.

- CLOUD BENEFITS:
  - Benefits beyond simply using "someone else's computer."
  - Do things better and faster.
    1. High availability and scalability:
      - High ability to allow a computer system running even if disrupted.
        - Downtime is bad for business. Introduce redundancy.
          - Extra servers require time and money.
        - Cloud provides easy availability. More servers. No hardware failures.
        - Clustered. Load-balanced.
        - Cloud vendor provides uptime guarantee for underlying service. (SLA.)
      - Scaling to increase resources to meet demand.
        - Cloud-scaling. Instantly and automatically adjusting resources.
          - And position servers closer to traffic.
          - Horizontal versus vertical scaling:
            - Horizontal: Scale out: Adding additional VMs. Load balancer. Typical cloud model.
            - Vertical: Scale up. Increase compute resources on existing VMs.
              - Manual. Requires downtime or reboot.
    2. Reliability and predictability:
      - Reliability recover from failures and disasters and continue to function.
        - Ensure that there is no single point of failure. Decentralized design.
        - Deploy to multiple locations. Global-scale computing. 
          - Protects against regional failures.
      - Predictability: 
        - Predictable performance. Consistent, all of the time.
          - Regardless of demand and customer location. Ensure enough resources.
          - Plan deployment around cloud-native best practices.
        - Predictable costs: Accurately track and forecast costs.
          - Real-time cost tracking. Pricing calculators. Analytics to optimize.

        - "Of" the cloud and "In" the cloud.
          - "Of:" Control cloud resources. Monitoring. Autoscaling.
          - "In:" How you interact. Variety of interaction tools.
  - Exam tips:
    - Broader themes: Automation + instantly available resources.
      - Automatically create instantly available resources.
    - Decentralize critical infrastructure. Global distribution, automatic failover.
    - Describe each benefit within the AZ-900 exam. And name the specific benefit for each.
    - High availability means systems are always available. Even automatically.
    - Scalability refers to scaling out or scaling up while automatically providing resources as needed.
    - Reliability describes how Azure can tolerate failures or even disasters.
    - Predictability is knowing your application will always perform as expected and knowing what it will cost.
    - Security is having full control of your cloud security posture.
    - Governance is standardizing cloud deployments to meet requirements/standards.
    - Manageability is control of cloud resources and how we interact with them.
